/**
 * This package and its sub-packages contain classes related to picocli command line processing.
 * This includes the top-level (sub-)command tree, picocli-related annotations, generic mixin's
 * and any other generic functionality related to picocli command line processing.
 * 
 * TODO Maybe rename this to 'picocli' with subpackages 'command', 'annotation', 'mixin'?
 *      That would avoid the need to put all generic classes that are not directly related
 *      to command implementations in the util package.
